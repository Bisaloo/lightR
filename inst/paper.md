# Summary

Living organisms wildly differ in their ability to see colours [@Osorio2008]. 
For this reason, colour science relies on the use of objective measurements of
reflectance, transmittance or aborbance spectra rather than human vision
[@Bennett1994;@Cuthill1999;@Eaton2005]. These spectra are then used in vision
models which allow scientists to predict how a given object is seen through the
eyes of a given species (e.g. how a male bird is seen by a potential mate). This
is the basis of all studies in for example the study of the evolution of colours
of animals and plants as communication signals

Spectrometers record the amount of captured photons at different wavelengths
(usually between 300-700 nm for colour science, as many species are sensitive to
ultraviolet radiations). However, there is no standard file format for
spectrometry data and different scientific instrumentation companies use wildly
different formats to store spectral data. This use of non-standard file formats
jeopardises scientific reproducibility [@Peng2009] as other researchers might
not have the (paid) tools to open these files, and it makes us dependent on a
third-party which might vanish anytime, leaving a trove of scientific data
impossible to access. Vendors proprietary software sometimes have an option to
convert those formats into human readable files such as `csv` but such softwares
are often expensive and they discard most metadata in the process. Yet, those
metadata are critical to ensure reproducibility of the measurements, and
ultimately of the scientific findings [@White2015].

In this article, we present `lightr`, an R package which aims at offering a
unified user-friendly interface for users to read reflectance, transmittance, 
absorbance spectra files from various formats in a single line of code. 
Additionally, it provides for the first time a fully free and open source
solution to read proprietary spectra file formats on all operating systems.

`lightr` started as a fork from the popular R package `pavo`, which provides a
large suite of colour analysis tools [@Maia2013;@Maia2019].

# Package design

`lightr` has been designed to provide two levels on the complexity / 
customability trade-off:

* Spectral data and metadata for each file format are extracted using 
specialized parsers. Parsers are also aliased with many different names so that
users can often use `lr_parse_$extension()` where `$extension` is the file 
extension of the file to parse. For convenience, we also provide a generic 
fallback, named `lr_parse_generic()` that works for many "simple" formats, often
derived from `csv` or `tsv`. Specialized parsers should usually be preferred to
`lr_parse_generic()` because `lr_parse_generic()` is not able to parse metadata.

* Because spectrometers store each measurement in a separate file, the number of
files for a single study can quickly increase. To ensure easy and efficient 
processing of those files, `lightr` also provides three high-levels functions
that can recursively find files and process them with a parallelized loop using
the `parallel` R package: `lr_get_spec()` and `lr_get_metadata()` which import
respectively spectral data and metadata as `data.frame` in R, as well as 
`lr_convert_tocsv()` which convert all spectra files in a given folder as `csv`,
which the same filename (minus the file extension).

```
library(lightr)
lr_convert_tocsv(where = "yourfolder", ext = "ProcSpec")
```

# Recommended workflow

As mentioned earlier, proprietary spectrometry softwares can also export 
spectral data into a human-readable format (usually a kind of tabulation
separated values, or `tsv`, with a complex header). `lightr` can read files 
generated by this export step. We however
**do not recommend you use the software built-in export function**,
because it will apply possibly unwanted transformation to your data
(interpolation and  subsetting) and may discard important metadata.

Instead, we recommend you keep the files in the proprietary format (such as
Avantes `ABS`, `ROH` and `TRM`, or OceanOptics `ProcSpec` and `jdx`) and that
you use `lightr` to convert them into your preferred file format (such as 
`csv`). 

# Usage and future directions

`lightr` can serve as a basis to colour analysis R packages to deal with the
file import step. Most of them can indeed only read a limited variety of file
formats currently. It is for example planned to become a dependency to the 
vision model package `pavo`. For example:

```
library(lightr)
specs <- lr_get_spec(where = "yourfolder", ext = "ProcSpec")

library(pavo)
plot(specs, col = spec2rgb(specs))
```

![](specs_joss.pdf)

```
summary(specs, subset = TRUE)
```

The first column indicates the brightness (in % relative to a white reference),
the second is the saturation (also called spectral purity) and the last contains
the hue (in nm).

`lightr` can also prove useful for developers of 
other programming languages, providing a free and open source template which can
easily be translated.
We also plan on providing a web application based on shiny 
(<https://github.com/rstudio/shiny>), which uses `lightr` in the background, and
provides users with limited R or technical knowledge with a simple and 
convenient way to convert all their proprietary files to `csv`.
