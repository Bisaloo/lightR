# Summary

Living organisms wildly differ in their ability to see colours. For this reason,
colour science relies on the use of objective measurements of reflectance,
transmittance or aborbance spectra rather than human vision (@Bennett1994,
@Cuthill1999,@Eaton2005).

Spectrometers record the amount of captured photons at different wavelengths 
(usually between 300-700 nm for colour sicence). However, there is no standard 
file format for spectrometry data and different scientific instrumentation 
companies use wildly different formats to store spectral data. Vendors 
proprietary software sometimes have an option to convert those formats into
human readable files such as `.csv` but such softwares are often expensive and
they discard most metadata in the process. Yet, those metadata are critical
to ensure reproducibility of the measurements, and ultimately of the scientific
findings (@White2015).

In this article, we present `lightr`, an R package which aims at offering a
unified user-friendly interface for users to read reflectance, transmittance, 
absorbance spectra files from various formats in a single line of code. 
Additionally, it provides for the first time a fully free and open source
solution to read proprietary spectra file formats on all systems.

`lightr` started as a fork from the popular R package `pavo`, which provides
a large suite of colour analysis tools (@Maia2013, @White2018).

# Package design

`lightr` has been designed to provide two levels on the complexity / 
customability trade-off:

* Spectral data and metadata for each file format are extracted using 
specialized parsers. Parsers are also aliased with many different names so that
users can often use `parse_$extension()` where `$extension` is the file 
extension of the file to parse. For convenience, we also provide a generic 
fallback, named `parse_generic()` that works for many "simple" formats, often
derived from `csv` or `tsv`. Specialized parsers should usually be preferred to
`parse_generic()` because `parse_generic()` is not able to parse metadata.

* Because spectrometers store each measurement in a separate file, the number of
files for a single study can quickly increase. To ensure easy and efficient 
processing of those files, `lightr` also provides three high-levels functions
that can recursively find files and process them with a parallelized loop using
the `parallel` R package.

# Recommended workflow

As mentioned earlier, proprietary spectrometry softwares can also export 
spectral data into a human-readable format (usually a kind of tabulation
separated values, or `tsv`, with a complex header). `lightr` can read files 
generated by this export step. We however
**do not recommend you use the software built-in export function**,
because it will apply possibly unwanted transformation to your data
(interpolation and  subsetting) and may discard important metadata.

Instead, we recommend you keep the files in the proprietary format (such as
Avantes `ABS`, `ROH` and `TRM`, or OceanOptics `ProcSpec` and `jdx`) and that
you use `lightr` to convert them into your preferred file format (such as 
`csv`).
