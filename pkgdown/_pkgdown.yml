  title: Read Spectrometric Data and Metadata in R
  description: >
    Parse various reflectance/transmittance/absorbance spectra file
    formats (Avantes, OceanInsight, CRAIC, ...) to extract spectral
    data and metadata, as described in Gruson, White
    & Maia (2019) <doi:10.21105/joss.01857>.
    This package has been peer-reviewed by rOpenSci (v. 0.1).

  - title: High-level functions
    desc: These functions offers an intuitive and user-friendly way to import (and possibly) transform multiple files at once in a given location.
    contents:
    - lr_get_spec
    - lr_get_metadata
    - lr_convert_tocsv
  - title: Low-level parsers
    desc: These functions are destined to advanced users that want a more flexible way to import spectral data. They can only read a single file at a time and users are responsible for writing a loop if necessary.
